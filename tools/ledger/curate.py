"""Curate the raw step-4c diff into a 60-second "Since yesterday" card.

The raw match output is honest but unreadable (600+ "new" rows, because the 19
research agents reword every headline and the dictionary was built by an older
extractor). Per the routine spec the card lists only what a reader should
actually notice, and `new_more` carries the count of the remaining genuinely-new
items -- with commentary bullets ("Worth your weekend", "Signals worth
watching") excluded from BOTH the list and the count, since they are the
agents' own analysis rather than news.
